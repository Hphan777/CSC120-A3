- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I imagined it would be more specific and difficult than Python

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?

Java is more specific than Python. Java uses class, object, and method along with scanner. Both still use if and else statements, while and for loop, random, arrays, and split method. I think some of the structure rules are similar like making sure to end the function with a semi colon. The difference is that Java has specific methods that you have to be familiar with along with different syntax. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I had a hard time making the mirror method to work, so I had help from Emily, Hala, and Alex, so we use the for loop in the for loop to mirror "input" and "replacement." Due to limited time, I am aware that there are adjustments to make specifically on line 86 and spaceing out the transcript in each line. I also want to learn more on how to do the pronuncation functions and me/I dilemma. My advice is to work with others so it take less time to finish as well as seek help from TA and office hours. It's important to ask many questions as possible and know what type of learner you are. I think communication is also important because I have difficulty understanding a concept sometimes by the way the information is excecuated.
