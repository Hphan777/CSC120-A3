Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Seyeon, Seunghyeon, Emily, Alex, and Hala
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I imagined it would be more scary and difficult than Java 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?

Java is more specific than Python. Java doesn't use elif. Java uses class, object, and method along with scanner. Both still use if and else statements, while and for loop, random, arrays, and split method. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I had a hard time making the mirror method to work, so I had help from Emily, Hala, and Alex, so we use the for loop in the for loop to mirror "input" and "replacement." Due to limited time, I am aware that there are adjustments to make specifically on this reflection and transcript.
